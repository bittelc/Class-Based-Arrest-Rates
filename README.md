### Objective

Arrest rates among people of disadvantaged circumstances are a commonly cited statistic in arguments both for and against present-day oppression. Trends in arrest rates across classes can help to inform the public about class-based discrimitation.
This repository will serve as a centralized map for comparing arrest rates across class-based groups such as socioeconomic, race, religion, and sexual orientation.
It will not attempt to draw conclusions from the data, and instead will provide it in an organized graphical presentation.

Likewise, longitudinal data about hate crimes can provide relevant information to the same arguments for and against the idea that opression continues in the present.
Hate crimes are also relevent in underlying trends across classes. For this reason, graphical representations will also be provided for hate crimes.

### Contributions

There are three primary areas in which contributions can be made to this project

1. Data Gathering
2. Graphical Prettification
3. Miscellaneous

##### Data Gathering

As this is a data-driven site, data gathering is the most critical component for making it relevant. As made obvious from the References detail, high-quality sources have been hard to come by. While it would be an unfortunate conclusion, it may be the case that data must be obtained by HTML and PDF scraping. This has yet to be determined.

To make contributions to the data-gathering aspect of this project:

- you may either edit this file (README.md) directly, and append any potential references to the "References for Data" section. This requires little-to-no development experience
- you may submit a pull request, crafting the database schema with relevant columnization or configuring a high-availability cloud-based MySQL database.

##### Graphical Prettification

This page will likely feature many JavaScript-based graphs throughout, and furthermore, are the primary objectives of this repository. A lead developer, preferably with experience creating graphs, is in high demand!


##### Miscellaneous

Obviously, there is much work to be done for this site. Most of it remains undocumente or not-yet-thought-of! If you have ideas for directions for this site, don't be shy! Have a mockup for a nice graphic look? Does the page have typos? :)

Ideas are best submitted to this repository by means of an edit to this README.md, or if that doesn't fit well, submit an "Issue" to this codebase detailing your thoughts!

All ideas are welcome, and will be responded to immediately!

### Fund Us

This site is being developed and hosted from pockets of those who are making contributions. However, more time can be devoted to this project if donations are made. Specifically, we are actively looking for funding for a centralized, production database, such as a MySQL database on AWS. Likewise, once this site is functional and relevant, we will look for domain hosting, though hosters like AWS. A contribution to pay this expense is the best place to start helping this project, if you are an active codebase contributor.

To discuss these possibilities and potential costs, please email me at cole.bittel@gmail.com
