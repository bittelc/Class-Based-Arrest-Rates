### Objective

Trends in arrest rates across classes can help to inform the public. This repository will serve as a centralized map for comparing arrest rates across class-based groups such as socioeconomics, race, religion, and sexual orientation. It will not attempt to draw conclusions from the data, and instead will provide it an organized graphic presentation.

Hate crimes are also relevent in underlying trends across classes. For this reason, graphical representations will also be provided for hate crimes.
